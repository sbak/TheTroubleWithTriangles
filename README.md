for help with this synatx.

## Milestone One
Gui:
* JComboBox loads and displays 3 target images
* Next button shows 200 triangles with random vertices, random RGB color and
	random transparency
* At each generation, fitness value is correctly calculated and displayed
* Sleep slider, pause, back, and reset buttons work correctly
* code is commented, clear, and so on.
